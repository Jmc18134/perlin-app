# Perlin Noise Web-App
This is a web app which generates images using Perlin noise. Uses React, Rust + WebAssembly, and TypeScript.
I built this as a personal project to try and get my feet wet with both React and WebAssembly.

The app is now [deployed on GitHub Pages](https://jmc18134.github.io/perlin-app/).
